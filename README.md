# Java Object-Oriented Programming Coursework (Weeks 1–9)
This repository contains all programming exercises and projects completed for the Object-Oriented Programming module at Leeds Beckett University. All work has been developed and tested using the Eclipse IDE. The projects are organized by week and follow the structure of the university curriculum.

## Development Environment
- **IDE:** Eclipse IDE for Java Developers
- **Java Version:** JDK 8 or above
- **Build Tool:** None (standard Eclipse project setup)
- **Version Control:** Git (changes committed weekly)

### Week 8: Polymorphism and Interfaces
- Superclass references and dynamic method dispatch
- Using and implementing interfaces
- Projects:
  - Modified `Firm` with Vacation Days by role
  - `Password` class with custom encryption implementing `Encryptable`

### Week 9: Arrays and Data Structures
