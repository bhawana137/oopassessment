Punctuation Marks
Design and implement a program that counts the number of punctuation marks in the following string “Mary had a little lamb, her fleece was as 
white as snow, and everywhere Mary went, the lamb was sure to go. -that was a nice poem- the end. ”. Produce a table that shows how many times each
symbol occurred.
